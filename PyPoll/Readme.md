## In this assignment I was tasked to create a Python script that analyzes
## votes and calculates the following:
## 1. The total number of votes cast.
## 2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
## 3. The percentage of votes for each candidate
## 4. The total number of votes for each candidate
## 5. The winner of the election

## The script handles any similarly scripted dataset
