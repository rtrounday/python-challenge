## Unit 3 | Homework Assignment - PyBoss

## Description

## In this assignment I was tasked to create a Python script that analyzes
## employee data to support a transition to a new HR system.  The assignment
## requires changing employee records to be stored completely differently.
## A summary of changes include the following
## 1. Store Name separately as First name and Last name
## 2. Change data format to support "-" rather than "/"
## 3. Mask Social Security number
## 4. Change State to its abbreviation


## The script handles any similarly scripted dataset
